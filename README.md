A mid-term project of C Programing Language -- Calculator

We all know that pyhton terminal can do numerical computing:
>>> 1 + 1
>>> 2

However in C language, we should consider how to get sequential inputs, how to seperate them into meaningful "tokens", and
how to use the idea of recursion to compute the expression, staffs like that...

tips:
- Your input must be separated with a space
- minus "-" is supported
